### Nice to meet you! 
I'm Tobia or xXAI-botXx here. Aspiring data scientist and currently studying [artificial intelligence](https://www.hs-offenburg.de/studium/studiengaenge/bachelor/angewandte-kuenstliche-intelligenz/studieninteressierte) in germany.<br>
I started with Java and wanted to make games. After some 2D Games such like my 2D (low Budget) Bomberman i had enough of games and my dream was fulfilled in a certain way...<br>
Now i'm more interested in data and python.<br>
<br>
> If you asked yourself why xXAI-botXx than read it backwards butü§´

So...Enjoy my Projects! üòÑ

### Overview

I now, sometimes it can be difficult to get an overview of an account and thers projects from the outside. 
To simplify that, i listed my repositories by category and with some words to classify it easier:<br>

**Data Science Projects**
- [Wer hat gebohrt?](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Wer-hat-gebohrt)<br>
  In this project, an application was programmed that collects drilling data using a GUI and then tries to assign a driller to one of two people using ML algorithms. The 2 people had to create training data beforehand. Voltage, audio and current data are available.<br>
  This project is quite extensive and so I wrote my own API documentation for it. [Click here to see it](https://xxai-botxx.github.io/Wer-hat-gebohrt/) (I love itüòç).<br>
  This project contains many things. From data-collection to model-training to prediction and parallel programming, GUI-programming. It's a good project to see how nice a GUI can look with TKinter, too.
- [Job Posts Similarity](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Job-Posts-Similarity)<br>
  The task here is to find similar job posts using NLP. I used SpaCy for this task and this project was made in coorperation with Syon Kadkade.<br>
  Important part of this project was to analyse the problem and find a solution. Above all, I did very scientific work here.
- [Weather Analysis](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Weather-Analysis)<br>
  This project has the goal to visualize, explore and forcasting weather data. It's not finished yet and I started to load and wrangling weather data buyed from OpenWeatherMap for freiburg.<br>
  Visualization is done by using plotly. The forecasting should done by using PyTorch.
- [Weather Collection](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Weather-Collection)<br>
  This is a helper project for the Weather Analysis (before i saw that it doesn't work at all). It's about collecting data from a website over a period of time. Like every hour. For that I used Silenium Lib. And it works...partly. Unfortunaly the data collection regularly take a break for a few days...maybe thats a problem from replit where i run the code.<br>
  Today I would use other liberaies instead such as request-lib with BeatifulSoup-lib for collecting the data.
- [YouTube Advertising Blocking Bot](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/YouTube-Bot)<br>
  This is not supposed to be a real application and was not sufficiently developed for that. So don't use it for blocking advertising. It is a computer vision project to recognize objects in images. In this case a skip advertising-button recognition. It is developed for the german language and for my 2 monitors at home.
- And more are planned :)
<br>

**Other Python Projects**
- [Discord Bot](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Discord-Bot) -> not visible yet, but soon :)<br>
  It's about a alrounder Bot for discord. The bot offers a wide range of skills and is the perfect chat-assistent.<br>
  I invested a lot of time and the code is nowadays partwise a bit messy. But I love the bot. It can draw function, calculate calculations, flip a coin, play chess, play YouTube Videos as MP3 and much more!
- [Python Lair](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Python_Lair)<br>
  Python Lair is a block based python IDE programmed in python. It is a project for fun. I used PyQt for the GUI.
- [Chess](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Chess)<br>
  It's the logic of chess. It was so programmed, that I can implement it on diffrent plattforms like in my Discord Bot.
- [Textbased labyrinth RPG](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Textbasiertes-RPG)<br>
  Inspired from the greek mythology and the maze runner saga I programmed a textbased labyrinth game. Goal is to escape and find the next level. In future I want to implement enemies, combat-system and other things that I like.
- [Python Execution](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Python-Execution)<br>
  This repo contains to ipynb-files which shows very basic functionality from python. It's very interesting because you can use the python execution for analysing code. How? Watch the repo. It's worth it :)<br>
  On one side you can show and handle with AST's, these are a part of the python execution. The python code going to represent as tree and thats can be useful. The math-console brings that on the point.<br>
  Moreover you can see the C-byte-instructions of the code to improve the performance of your code.
- [Website Publisher](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Rainbow_Six_Website)<br>
  In this project I wrote a server-application for an old website of me over a game. I used flask to run the website locally.


<br>

**Java Repositories**
- [Pi-Collision](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Pi_Collisions)<br>
  It's about an application for showing the pi-collision effect. It's a small application with a GUI and some physics in it. The Pi-Collision-effect is that if 2 objects collide and there is a wall, the amount of collisions going to be the number of pi. It's very interesting. To go higher with the amount of collisions I implemted a performance mode, where nothing is drawing and the collisions going faster.  
- [Falling Champion](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Falling-Champion)<br>
  Falling Champion is the title of my own created game. I used Java to make a really fun game. Special for my games are the credits. I think it is a nice game and it was particularly important to me that it is a well-rounded overall package.
- [2D Bomberman](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/2D-Bomberman)<br>
  Another game heavily inspired of the original Bomberman. And there is an easter egg in the credits!
- [Interactive Text Adventure Reader](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Text-Adventure)<br>
  It should be an application for interactive stories and they should be written by the users it self too. Unfortunately i wasn't creative enough to write a nice story üòÇ

<br>

**Other Repositories**
- [Project Helper](https://github.com/xXAI-botXx/Project-Helper)<br>
  This repo should include important files which help me out. As example a guide for git.<br>
  It should grows over the time and should contain basic code as cook-recipes and guides to important topics.<br>
  Maybe you find something helpful, too.

<!-- Maybe add some pictures and videos directly here ? -->
<!-- Add README's to each repo and add pictures and videos for them -->

<br>
That are my repositories (since the date 06.06.2022). Let's going on!
